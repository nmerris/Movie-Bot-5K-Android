// I am attempting a min SDK of 11.. thus all the support libraries
// I have also read that it is good practice to use support libraries when possible, even if not
// necessarily needed, because that will allow the app to address Google API bugs between
// full releases, because Google publishes support library revisions more often than full OS
// version updgrades.  Addressing Google bugs would simply be a matter of repackaging and shipping
// out the same app, but with updated support libraries in the APK.


/**
 * A convenience class that prevents subclassing Activities from having to contain the same
 * FragmentManager code repeatedly, when loading a fragment into an Activity that hosts at least one single
 * fragment in a simple FrameLayout.
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, the subclassing Activity many not even need
 * to override onCreate at all.  Note that MenuDetailPagerActivity does not subclass this because
 * it needs it's FrameLayout to be wrapped in a ViewPager.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each subclassing Activity must implement createFragment, so this Activity knows what fragment
 * to put in fragment_container.
 * </p>
 *
 * Each subclassing Activity MAY override getLayoutResourceId if it wants to provide it's own
 * layout.  Every subclassing Activity that needs to run fragments in two different containers
 * MUST override getLayoutResourceId, as the default layout that this Activity inflates
 * has only one container for one fragment.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: MenuActivity extends AppCompatActivity
